# HackingWithSwift

Following Paul Hudson's Hacking With Swift programs to learn iOS development

Things you know 100% but might forget if someone asks ;--) ...

# Swift Lang
- Closures
  - closure capturing & mem leaks

# UIKit
- Lifecycle of View Controller

# SwiftUI
- Architecture: Model, Controller?
  - SwiftUI View is closer to a Controller (you are describing how things function while the app is running)
  - CoreData Model, dataController env object containing the container and thus the view context

# General
- APIs/Networking:
  - RESTful:
    - Get - read req. that returns data
    - Post - create operation (creates multiple times if requested)
    - Put - update (creates or replace)
    - Delete - deletes the resource
